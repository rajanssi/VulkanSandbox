My personal learning adventures with Vulkan.

Current goals with the project

- [x] Implement Vulkan basic renderer with somewhat sane design
- [x] glTF loading
- [x] glTF skinning

Especially glTF related tasks were largely implemented [imitating Sascha Willems examples](https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan). 

Future goals

- [ ] Material system
- [ ] imGUI integration
- [ ] Scene graph
- [ ] Other feature implementations from Sascha Willems' example repository
